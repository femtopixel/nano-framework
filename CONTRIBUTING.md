How to Contribute
=================

This project welcomes your contribution. There are several ways to help out:

* Create an [issue](https://github.com/femtopixel/nano-framework/issues/) on GitHub,
if you have found a bug or have an idea for a feature
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues

There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow, so that we have a
chance of keeping on top of things.

* The code must follow the [PSR-2 coding standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
* All code changes should be covered by unit tests

Issues
------

* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/femtopixel/nano-framework/issues/)
  * Make sure it does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce, when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you note the version you use.

Coding Standard
---------------

Make sure your code changes comply with the PSR-2 coding standard by
using [PHP Codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
from within your folder:

    composer phpcs

Check the `build/logs/checkstyle.xml` once it finished.
